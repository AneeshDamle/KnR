In the word-count program, a word is taken with a loose definition of being a
sequence of chars, that does not contain a blank, tab or newline.
Confining to this definition, testing could include:
    1   More than 1 spaces or tabs after a word
    2   No input sentence
    3   Input starting with newline
    4   Input ending with a blank, tab or newline.
    5   Joint words (Doubtful as a testing case as per definition)

Explanation for why our version of itoa does not handle INT_MIN conversion:

Suppose that an integer variable is assigned a space of n-bits in memory.
Each bits can be 0 or 1; thus, an integer variable can have 2^n values.
Thus, it can have 2^(n-1) negative values and 2^(n-1) non-negative values.
Thus, range of negative values: - 2^(n-1) to -1.
Range of positive values: 1 to 2^(n-1).

Thus, the absolute value of the largest negative number is 1 greater than the
largest positive number.
Hence, INT_MIN * -1 will not fit in an integer, and thus cannot be evaluated
using int variables.

But, interestingly, INT_MIN - 1 becomes INT_MAX. We can use this modify our
program.
